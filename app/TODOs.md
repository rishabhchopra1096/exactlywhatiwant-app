- But wil lthis actually make money? Will you actually use it? I'll only be able to use it, if I can really really customise what I want. So, you chat with it, make it _exactly how you want it_. And then see how it looks on multiple merchandises, and edit with the merchendise itself.
- Make sure the design history is maintained.
- People should be able to upload multiple images.
- The key interaction: Customise a design, and get it to your doorstep is something that's required to show.
- The best way to make it work:
  - Have templated T-shirts, Shirts, Notebooks whose color changes based on the logo.
  - Programmatically place the logo on the object. Completely changeable where to place it.
  - Use that to generate a video of a person using it [Wan]. Giving wan just the image of the design is stupid. It creates absolute non-sense.
  - You need to give it a proper image of a proper model, to show a video.
- Make the Landing Page.
- Make the experiment video.
